# HANDOFF — Track A (Data/Infra)

**Start here.** Canonical entry point for a fresh session on this track. Last updated
2026-08-12 (end of Weeks 11-13). Branch: `track-a-data-infra`. Worktree:
`D:\Capstone-worktrees\track-a-data-infra`.

Read this first, then `DATA_COLLECTION_STATUS.md` (real backend state + measurements),
`ORCHESTRATION.md` (pipeline design + the parallelization rule), `SCHEMA.md` (DB
contract other tracks build against).

---

## Current state (one paragraph)

The full data layer is **built, live, and collecting real data**. Supabase Postgres is
provisioned with 13 tables + 1 view (DDL in `supabase/migrations/`, applied in filename
order). `scripts/ingestion/orchestrator.py` is a working pipeline for all three
platforms — YouTube via the official Data API, Instagram and Reddit via OpenCLI driving
a real logged-in Chrome session. As of the last run: **24,043 datapoints across 15
curated creators, 7 of them at or over the 1,000-datapoint floor**, with relevance and
recency independently verified (Reddit topic-sub relevance 223/223 = 100%; zero rows
older than the rolling 6-month cutoff). Brand extraction works and has one proven real
positive case (Virat Kohli / Agilitas). What is **not** done: the v1 dataset is
deliberately **not frozen** (PROJECT_PLAN's Week 9-10 row says to freeze — do not,
several creators are still far below the floor); Instagram comment coverage is capped
by a page-render truncation that remains unsolved; and the scheduled daily task fires
but does not run to completion.

---

## Open items

| Item | Why it's open |
|---|---|
| **Scheduled task doesn't complete** — `CapstoneDataIngestion` (Task Scheduler, daily 10:00) fired on 2026-08-10, ran ~3 min of YouTube (2 channels), then stopped. No Instagram/Reddit sections, no completion marker, no traceback. | **Not started / needs diagnosis.** Earlier reporting said "scheduling works" — that was only half true (it *fires*; it doesn't *finish*). Suspect the PowerShell wrapper treats Python's stderr logging as a terminating error (log shows `python.exe :` prefixes and `At ...run_pipeline.ps1:26 char:5`). Check `$ErrorActionPreference` / stderr handling in `run_pipeline.ps1`. |
| **Instagram grid stalls at ~12 links** on most profiles despite `post_cap=40`; only `virat.kohli` reached the cap (48 links found). | **Not started.** This — not the post cap — is now the binding constraint on Instagram volume. |
| **Instagram high-engagement comment truncation** — page render shows only ~9-15 comments regardless of true count (measured 9 of 352,130 on a Cristiano post = 0.0026%). | **Blocked-ish.** Exhausted the non-risky options (load-more control, scrolling, network inspection). The remaining path is reverse-engineering Instagram's private GraphQL, which carries real ban risk — **needs a user decision**, not a unilateral call. |
| **4 creators structurally below floor** — Saina Nehwal (108), PV Sindhu (74), MC Mary Kom (208), Bhuvan Bam (1). | **Needs a user decision.** No dedicated audience surface (no own YouTube channel, no creator-specific subreddit), or an inactive channel. Options: widen the recency window, accept them as low-volume entities, or replace them in the target list. |
| **Freeze v1 dataset** (PROJECT_PLAN Week 9-10). | **Deliberately deferred** by user direction — freezing now locks in a dataset too thin for GAIL training. Revisit once more creators clear the floor. |
| **Instagram scroll change aborts instead of degrading** — raises `no post links found after scrolling` where older code took a partial screenful. | **Not started.** Turned partial results into total per-creator failures under contention. Should degrade, not abort. |

**Closed, do not reopen:** Apify is genuinely unavailable — checked across **three**
separate restart cycles (no MCP server, CLI, Python client, token, or config, ever).
Stop re-checking it each round.

## Non-obvious lessons (these are not visible from reading the code)

1. **OpenCLI arbitrates browser access via TAB LEASES from one daemon per Chrome
   profile — so no two OpenCLI-backed platforms can run concurrently.** Running
   Instagram and Reddit sub-agents in parallel starved Reddit out completely (0 of 8
   creators, all `TypeError: Failed to fetch`) while Instagram kept succeeding on the
   same browser. This is *not* a rate limit (failures were instant, at exactly our own
   3s gap; a real limit is an HTTP 429 from the platform). It cannot be fixed by naming
   sessions — only `opencli browser <session>` takes a name, site adapters don't.
   **Safe pattern: one sub-agent for YouTube ∥ one sub-agent doing Instagram then
   Reddit sequentially.** Full detail in `ORCHESTRATION.md`. YouTube is always safe —
   verified it makes zero browser calls (`urllib` straight to `googleapis.com`).

2. **Never trust a handle guessed from training knowledge — verify every one against
   the real API/profile first.** Hit repeatedly: `whitneysimmons` resolved to an
   unrelated 460-follower account; `neeraj_chopra1` and `mirzasania` to unrelated
   accounts; **4 of 5** guessed YouTube handles resolved to fan/unrelated channels. A
   wrong handle pollutes a real creator's data with a stranger's. Best verification
   trick found: **cross-platform corroboration** — Neeraj Chopra's YouTube listed
   management contact `connect@velsports.com`, matching the `velsports.co` in his
   already-verified Instagram bio.

3. **A volume number is meaningless without a relevance check attached.** Reported
   volume for two rounds before ever checking the rows were about the right people —
   then measured **0%** relevance on general subreddits (0 of 41 r/tennis posts
   mentioned Sania Mirza, etc.) and had to purge **88%** of Reddit data (289 of 330
   creator↔post links). Every volume figure quoted now carries a relevance number.

4. **Posting FREQUENCY, not audience size, predicts data volume.** Deeply
   counter-intuitive and it will mislead target selection: CarryMinati (45.7M subs)
   yielded 5 videos in the recency window; Bhuvan Bam (26.5M subs) yielded **zero**
   (all 40 most recent videos predate the cutoff); Mumbiker Nikhil (4.0M subs but 3,168
   lifetime videos) topped the entire dataset at 3,928 datapoints. **Filter future
   targets on upload cadence, not subscriber count.**

5. **"Tool X is now enabled/installed" is a statement of intent, not a guarantee this
   session can reach it — verify each claimed unblock independently.** Apify was
   reported enabled three times and never was. Notably one restart *did* deliver the
   `claude-in-chrome` tools while Apify still didn't arrive — so bundled claims resolve
   on **different timelines** and must be checked per-item, not accepted or rejected
   together.

6. **Merge-on-upsert is right for incrementally-discovered values and wrong for a
   curated source of truth.** The creator upsert merged Reddit source arrays, making it
   impossible to *reclassify* a subreddit — after re-seeding, Sania Mirza still had
   r/tennis flagged creator-specific. The curated target list is now authoritative
   (replace, not merge) for those fields.

7. **Windows/encoding gotchas that cost real debugging time:** `subprocess.run(text=True)`
   defaults to cp1252 and crashes on emoji in real comment text — force
   `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"`. Bare `"opencli"` won't resolve via
   `CreateProcess` (npm `.cmd` shim) — use `shutil.which()`. `opencli reddit user -f json`
   crashes on emoji fields but `-f yaml` works. PowerShell's profile prints a banner that
   makes naive `grep -q .` liveness checks always true — use `-NoProfile`.

## Exact next steps

1. **Diagnose the scheduled task** (highest value — it's the difference between a
   pipeline and a manual script). Start with stderr handling in `run_pipeline.ps1`; the
   log strongly suggests PowerShell aborts on Python's stderr logging output.
2. **Fix the Instagram ~12-link grid stall** — biggest single lever on Instagram volume.
3. **Get a user decision** on the two blocked items above: the Instagram comment
   truncation (GraphQL = ban risk), and what to do about the 4 structurally-low creators.
4. **When the target list changes, re-run ALL platforms, not just the reworked one.**
   Cost a round: added 6 creators, ran only Reddit, and they showed ~0 volume until
   YouTube was re-run — at which point three of them jumped straight over the floor.
5. Re-check other tracks before assuming interfaces hold:
   `git fetch origin && git show origin/track-c-fusion-backend:API_CONTRACTS.md`
   (also `origin/track-b-ml-core:GRAPH_SCHEMA.md`).

## How to run it

```bash
cd scripts/ingestion
PY="C:/Users/Sonic/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe"
"$PY" orchestrator.py --seed target_list.json                       # seed/refresh creators (authoritative)
"$PY" orchestrator.py --platform youtube  --target-list target_list.json
"$PY" orchestrator.py --platform instagram --target-list target_list.json
"$PY" orchestrator.py --platform reddit   --target-list target_list.json   # never concurrent with instagram
```
Needs `.env` at repo root (gitignored, never committed): `DATABASE_URL`,
`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `OPENCLI_PROFILE`. Instagram/Reddit need **real Chrome** open and
logged in — **not Arc** (Arc connects but every command hangs; documented in
`DATA_COLLECTION_STATUS.md`).

## ⚠️ INSTAGRAM RATE LIMIT REACHED — HTTP 429 (2026-08-11, Phase 1B pilot)

`opencli instagram profile <any handle>` now returns **HTTP 429**, including for a
control account (`nasa`), and it persisted across a 20s re-probe. This is a **genuine
platform rate limit**, categorically different from the `HTTP 400 - make sure you are
logged in` failures seen intermittently all session — and it matches this file's own
lesson 1 criterion verbatim: *"a real limit is an HTTP 429 from the platform."*

**What triggered it:** cumulative Instagram request volume in one day — a ~9-hour
discovery loop, then a 97-post caption backfill, then a 97-post collab/edge pass
(~200 post-page fetches inside a few hours), then the deepening pilot.

**Consequence: Instagram deepening cannot proceed until this clears.** The Phase 1B
pilot collected 0 Instagram datapoints for all 4 pilot creators. YouTube (official API,
independent transport) and Reddit were unaffected and worked normally.

**Before resuming Instagram work:** probe a single `instagram profile nasa` call and
confirm a real result. Do NOT run a bulk job to "see if it works" — that is what
accumulated the limit. Back off in hours, not minutes.

## UNFINISHED: collab pass killed mid-run 2026-08-11 (resume this)

`collab_edges.py` over all 97 posts was **killed at ~83/97**, so its edge INSERT and
co-author sheet push — both of which run at the END — never executed for that pass.

**What persisted (written incrementally, per-post):** `has_paid_partnership_label` for
83 of 97 posts (80 false, 3 true, 14 still NULL) and all caption fixes. Verified clean:
82 non-null captions / 82 distinct.

**What was lost:** edges and co-author candidates from the ~53 posts beyond the first
paced batch. Current totals (20 edge rows / 2 resolved / 18 sheet candidates) come from
the earlier 30-post run only.

**To finish:** re-run `python collab_edges.py` (~18 min at the 5s pacing). It is safe to
re-run — UNIQUE(creator_id, platform, handle) prevents duplicate edges, the caption
update is guarded by a strictly-longer check, and the sheet push dedups on
instagram_handle. Do NOT run Reddit concurrently with it.

**Lesson worth keeping:** batch-terminal writes are fragile for long browser jobs. The
per-post writes (captions, paid-partnership flag) all survived the kill; the
end-of-run writes did not. Future long passes should flush edges incrementally too.
